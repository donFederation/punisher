## About Punisher
###The Sub-Orbit &amp; Versatile, Deep Inverted Client King

Punisher is a PHP web proxy class. It automates retrieving web page content and posting forms, for example.

Some of Punisher's features:
* easily fetch the text from a web page
* supports proxy hosts
* supports basic user & pass authentication
* supports setting user_agent, referer, cookies and header content
* expands fetched links to fully qualified URLs
* easily fetch the the links from a web page
* supports browser redirects, and controlled depth of redirects
* easily submit form data and retrieve the results
* supports following html frames
* easily fetch the contents of a web page
* supports passing cookies on redirects
	

#### NB: Punisher requires PHP with PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions), and the OpenSSL extension for fetching HTTPS requests.	

#####fetch($URI)

```
This is the method used for fetching the contents of a web page.
$URI is the fully qualified URL of the page to fetch.
The results of the fetch are stored in $this->results.
If you are fetching frames, then $this->results
contains each frame fetched in an array.
```

#####fetchtext($URI)

```
This behaves exactly like fetch() except that it only returns
the text from the page, stripping out html tags and other
irrelevant data.		
```

#####fetchform($URI)

```
This behaves exactly like fetch() except that it only returns
the form elements from the page, stripping out html tags and other
irrelevant data.		
```

#####fetchlinks($URI)

```
This behaves exactly like fetch() except that it only returns
the links from the page. By default, relative links are
converted to their fully qualified URL form.
```

#####submit($URI,$formvars)

```
This submits a form to the specified $URI. $formvars is an
array of the form variables to pass.
```

#####submittext($URI,$formvars)

```
This behaves exactly like submit() except that it only returns
the text from the page, stripping out html tags and other
irrelevant data.		
```

#####submitlinks($URI)

```
This behaves exactly like submit() except that it only returns
the links from the page. By default, relative links are
converted to their fully qualified URL form.
```

## Examples

#### Example: 	fetch a web page and display the return headers and the contents of the page (html-escaped):

```
	include "Punisher.class.php";
	$punisher = new Punisher;
	
	$punisher->user = "joe";
	$punisher->pass = "bloe";
	
	if($punisher->fetch("http://www.slashdot.org/"))
	{
		echo "response code: ".$punisher->response_code."<br>\n";
		while(list($key,$val) = each($punisher->headers))
			echo $key.": ".$val."<br>\n";
		echo "<p>\n";
		
		echo "<PRE>".htmlspecialchars($punisher->results)."</PRE>\n";
	}
	else
		echo "error fetching document: ".$punisher->error."\n";

```

#### Example:	submit a form and print out the result headers and html-escaped page:

```
	include "Punisher.class.php";
	$punisher = new Punisher;
	
	$submit_url = "http://lnk.ispi.net/texis/scripts/msearch/netsearch.html";
	
	$submit_vars["q"] = "amiga";
	$submit_vars["submit"] = "Search!";
	$submit_vars["searchhost"] = "Altavista";

		
	if($punisher->submit($submit_url,$submit_vars))
	{
		while(list($key,$val) = each($punisher->headers))
			echo $key.": ".$val."<br>\n";
		echo "<p>\n";
		
		echo "<PRE>".htmlspecialchars($punisher->results)."</PRE>\n";
	}
	else
		echo "error fetching document: ".$punisher->error."\n";

```

#### Example:	showing functionality of all the variables:

```

	include "Punisher.class.php";
	$punisher = new Punisher;

	$punisher->proxy_host = "my.proxy.host";
	$punisher->proxy_port = "8080";
	
	$punisher->agent = "(compatible; MSIE 4.01; MSN 2.5; AOL 4.0; Windows 98)";
	$punisher->referer = "http://www.microsnot.com/";
	
	$punisher->cookies["SessionID"] = 238472834723489l;
	$punisher->cookies["favoriteColor"] = "RED";
	
	$punisher->rawheaders["Pragma"] = "no-cache";
	
	$punisher->maxredirs = 2;
	$punisher->offsiteok = false;
	$punisher->expandlinks = false;
	
	$punisher->user = "joe";
	$punisher->pass = "bloe";
	
	if($punisher->fetchtext("http://www.phpbuilder.com"))
	{
		while(list($key,$val) = each($punisher->headers))
			echo $key.": ".$val."<br>\n";
		echo "<p>\n";
		
		echo "<PRE>".htmlspecialchars($punisher->results)."</PRE>\n";

	else
		echo "error fetching document: ".$punisher->error."\n";

```

#### Example: 	fetched framed content and display the results

```
	include "Punisher.class.php";
	$punisher = new Punisher;
	
	$punisher->maxframes = 5;
	
	if($punisher->fetch("http://www.ispi.net/"))
	{
		echo "<PRE>".htmlspecialchars($punisher->results[0])."</PRE>\n";
		echo "<PRE>".htmlspecialchars($punisher->results[1])."</PRE>\n";
